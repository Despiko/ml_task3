# ml_task3
In this task, i tried new approach for me. How to use logging function for ml expirements.
You need to use this commands:

git clone git@github.com:Despiko/ml_task3.git
cd ml_task3

docker-compose build

docker-compose up

And after that you can open 0.0.0.0:5050 in you browser.
In first docker container i created experiment, that you can see in mlflow server.
